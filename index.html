			<h3> About Me</h3>
			<div>
				<p> Learn from fucking criticism. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. </p>
				<p>If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure. Fuck. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Use your fucking hands. </p>
